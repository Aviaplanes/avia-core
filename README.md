## 📖 Overview

**avia-core** is the front-end repository for my personal digital identity. It serves as a central hub for my projects, social links, and developer persona. 

The site is designed with a dark, underground, Web3-native aesthetic, moving away from standard corporate templates to deliver a unique user experience.

> *"I build low-level software, blockchain infrastructure, and automation bots. Niche market player & Web3 enjoyer."*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features

While my primary focus is Rust and Python backend engineering, this project demonstrates my ability to build modern, performant web interfaces:

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and optimized performance.
- **Language:** 100% TypeScript for type safety.
- **UX/UI:** 
  - Integrated custom audio player.
  - Background video rendering.
  - Smooth scrolling implemented via `Lenis` for a fluid user experience.
